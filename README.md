# Chat Homies<br><br>
Chat Homies is an interactive application that allows users to customize the personality and behavior of the ChatGPT model. 
Whether you want a friendly assistant, a witty conversationalist, or a quirky character, this application lets you tailor the AI’s responses to your liking.

## Features<br><br>
### Personality Customization:<br>
Choose from one of these predefined personas to give the model a unique personality. <br>_note: Personalities not based on real people_
1. **SuperBot** - SuperBot is a superhero who believes in justice above all. He has a great sense of morality and wants the user to always do the right thing. Whether it's fighting crime or saving those in need, SuperBot is here to help!
2. **Wolanda** - Wolanda is an old-school and family-oriented woman who will respond to the user as if they are one of her many children. She's sweet, full of knowledge, and everyone's favorite auntie!
3. **ChadBot** - ChadBot is set to mimic the stereotypical "college frat guy". Aside from his intense ego and arrogance, ChadBot will not have much knowledge to share to the user. 
4. **Guru** (still in the works) - When fully functional, the goal is for Guru to give the user insightful assistance with trading stocks. 
5. **IMG** - Allows the user to generate an image by inputting an image prompt. See "**Image Generation**" for more details. 
6. **Teddy** - Allows the user to upload a .txt/.pdf file to be used as additional information for responses. See "**Textbook Integration**" for more details. 
<br>


### Image Generation:<br>
Choose **IMG** to begin!<br><br>
Input a prompt and the model will generate a link.
Describe an image, and the AI will generate text based on what it “sees.”
Copy and paste this link into a web browser to see your image!
Ideal for storytelling, visual descriptions, or generating new ideas.
### Textbook Integration:<br>
Choose **Teddy** to begin!<br><br>
Upload textbooks, articles, or any relevant content.
The AI will incorporate knowledge from these sources into its responses.
Only allows up to ~3 pages of the content, as OpenAI's information storage is limited.<br>

## Installation<br><br>
1. Install the code. All files (except the .exe) required to open the program from your IDE.
2. In your terminal, install OpenAI: _pip install OpenAI_
3. Generate an API key from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and replace the key between the parenthesis after _openai.api_key_. The key in place is deactivated and is soley a placeholder.
4. Run!
   <br><br>Note: If you run into any additional missing libraries, run _pip install [missing_library_name]_
